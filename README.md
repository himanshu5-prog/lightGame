A simple game based on codechef question - Lights out

The game consist of 10 x 10 array of LEDs. When the led is left clicked, the color gets toggled. Apart from the selected LED, non-diagonal LEDs also get toggled.

Initially all the LEDs are assigned randomly as green/blue. Try to make all LEDs of blue color.

Have fun!
